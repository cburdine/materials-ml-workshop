# Introduction to Machine Learning
Now that we have covered some of the basics of scientific Python programming (the first half of this workshop), we are ready to begin our journey into the world of Machine Learning. In this second half of the course, we will apply our Python programming skills to develop, train, and evaluate models that make intelligent predictions based on large datasets. We will also investigate how these models can be applied to several different problems in the materials science domain.

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (often abbreviated as ML) is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on how data and computational processes can be applied to provide systems the ability to learn from experience without the need for explicit programming. Essentially, ML focuses on two things: 

(I) The development of computational models that make predictions, identify trends, etc.
(II) The computational methods that can be applied to improve these models based on data.

 Today, many scientific fields are achieving significant breakthroughs on some of their toughest problems, especially problems where a lot of data points have been accumulated but there is lack of a robust theory to explain it.

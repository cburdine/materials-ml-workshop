# Materials + ML Workshop

This is the latest draft of a Jupyter Book containing self-paced tutorials for a Material Science Workshop tutorial. This book is still a work and progress, but I anticipate this will be the best format for a Workshop where we might be having multiple students coming from different levels of familiarity with statistics, mathematics, materials science, and computing in Python.

:::{admonition} Any Ideas?
:class: tip
If you have an ideas as to how this workshop could be better structured, let me know!

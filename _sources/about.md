# Materials + ML Workshop

This is the latest draft of a Jupyter Book containing self-paced tutorials for a Material Science Workshop tutorial. This book is still a work and progress, but I anticipate this will be the best format for a Workshop where we might be having multiple students coming from different levels of familiarity with statistics, mathematics, materials science, and computing in Python.

If you have an ideas as to how this workshop could be better structured, let me know!
